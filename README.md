# DNSFlip

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

**DNSFlip** is a handy little tool that takes the hassle out of changing your systemâ€™s DNS settings. Instead of digging through Windows menus, just fire up DNSFlip, pick what you want from the simple menu, and voilÃ  â€” your DNS is switched instantly!

## What can DNSFlip do?
- Quickly connect to your favorite DNS service (like OpenDNS, Google, Cloudflare, and more)  
- Manage your own list of DNS IPs â€” add new ones, edit, delete, or pick which one is active  
- Choose which network interface you want to apply DNS settings to (Wi-Fi, Ethernet, etc.)  
- Reset everything back to automatic with just one click

## How to use it?
1. Run **DNSFlip.exe** as an administrator (important, otherwise it canâ€™t change your DNS)  
2. Youâ€™ll see a menu like this:
```markdown
=== DNSFlip ===
1. Connect DNS (OpenDNS)
2. Manage DNS IPs
3. Manage Network Interface (Wi-Fi)
4. Reset to Automatic DNS
0. Exit
Choice:
```

3. Pick your choice by typing the number and pressing Enter 
4. Explore the menus, add your DNS profiles, and switch easily!


## Why run as admin?
Because DNS settings affect your whole system, Windows needs you to have administrator rights to make changes. So remember: right-click and choose **Run as administrator**!


## Wanna download the executable?
Check out the [Releases](https://github.com/ArashMaghsoodi/DNSFlip/releases) page to grab the latest ready-to-run version.

## How to build it yourself
If you want to compile the project from source, hereâ€™s a quick way:

```bash
g++ -Wall -Wextra -g3 *.cpp -o DNSFlip.exe
```
(For best results, compile on Windows with a C++17 compiler)

Thanks for checking out DNSFlip!
